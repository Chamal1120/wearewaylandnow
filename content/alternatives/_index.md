ℹ️ _This page is work in progress, please check back later._

The goal of this page is to not only see a list of common apps with Wayland support like on the front page,
but also to see which 1:1 replacements there are for apps that don't work well with Wayland.

Just press **Ctrl**+**F** and search for a tool to see alternatives.
